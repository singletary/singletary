**My Apple product wish list**: Feels like a good time to be an Apple user. Current lineup extremely impressive. Here's what I want:

- AirPods for use in bed
- iPad Pro 10.5 for the pencil, really
- New non-7S iPhone for the camera and wireless charging
- HomePod since I'm obsessed w/ smart home speakers

More brief thoughts on why over the next week.
