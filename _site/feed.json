			"content_html": "<p><strong>2017 End of Year Smart Home Report</strong>: This was a big year for my smart home. Lots of time and money invested in connected products to help secure my home and to make things more fun and enjoyable. The buzzword was “connected,” and I tried hard to apply this to every tech. product we bought.</p>\n\n<p>Some winners:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><a href=\"https://eero.com/shop/pro-wifi-system\">eero Pro WiFi System</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.arlo.com/en-us/products/arlo-pro/default.aspx\">Arlo Pro Wireless Security Cameras</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://shop.ring.com/products/video-doorbell-2\">Ring Video Doorbell 2</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.ihomeaudio.com/iSP100BC/\">iHome Wireless Outdoor Smart Plug</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/50049-Outdoor-Wireless-Grounded-Outlets/dp/B00ZYLQZEK\">WiOn Wireless Outdoor Smart Plug (two sockets)</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.wink.com/products/wink-hub-2/\">Wink Hub 2</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/connect.html\">Sonos</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>P.S.: No referral links above. Click away!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Eero</strong> fixed me WiFi speed issues since upgrading to a gigabit line with FiOS. AirPort Extremes underperformed, unfortunately. <strong>Arlo</strong> lets me keep an eye on my home when I’m gone, and enables some great integrations with smart lights. Same goes for <strong>Ring 2</strong>, which I upgraded to from the original Ring. Huge image quality boost, fewer false motion alerts, excellent battery life. <strong>Outdoor smart plugs</strong> are my new jam — holiday decorations + automation = bliss. Finally got the new <strong>Wink Hub 2</strong>, which I needed for the switch for my outdoor porch light. <strong>Sonos</strong> stepped up, integrating with Amazon Echo, making it WAY easier to play music throughout my home. <strong>Interesting</strong>: Over half of my favorites are outdoor smart home products.</p>\n\n<p>Some losers:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Google Home</li>\n  <li>Apple HomeKit</li>\n  <li>Apple HomePod</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Google Home sucks. I said it. A firmware update required that I remove and re-add every smart home product… by design. It literally voice prompted me to do this when I tried to control my lights after the update. HomeKit feels like it doesn’t exist. I have many HomeKit-capable products, but never think to ask Siri to use them. Finally, <strong>WHERE IS MY HOMEPOD?</strong></p>\n\n<p>What’s your favorite smart home product or integration?</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p><strong>Redundant backups</strong>: I wanted to find a solution to securely store my Time Machine backups in an off-site location, so that they were backed up redundantly. I currently back up to a home server with a RAID setup, just for backups, and decided to sync these backups to a cloud storage provider. <a href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html\">Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage</a> is cheap ($0.005/GB/m) and was easy to get set up with <a href=\"https://rclone.org/b2/\">rclone</a>, so I decided to give that a shot. A simple script and crontab entry later, and I’ve fully automated my redundant remote backup solution. Excited to see how this works out!</p>\n",
